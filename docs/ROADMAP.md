# Loom Roadmap

Living plan. The spec module (the compiler front-end) is done; everything below turns the
validated Ontology Model into a running system. Ordered so each milestone is independently
demoable — you can *see* the ontology do something new at the end of each.

Design decisions these build on live in [`spec-v0.md`](./spec-v0.md): one YAML spec compiles to
four surfaces; reads go through an engine-agnostic IR; writes are single-object via the Iceberg
catalog.

---

## ✅ Done — M0: Spec module (compiler front-end)

- [x] Canonical type system (`types.py`) — each type → `{Iceberg, JSON Schema}`, promotion rules
- [x] Expression mini-language (`expr.py`) — tokenizer + Pratt parser → AST
- [x] Typed Ontology Model (`model.py`)
- [x] Structural loader (`loader.py`) — one-kind-per-file, unknown-key errors, shape checks
- [x] Referential/semantic validator (`validator.py`) — accumulates all errors
- [x] `loom validate` CLI · 36 tests · CI

---

## ✅ Done — M1: Read slice, end to end: catalog → query → MCP

*Goal: point an MCP client at a Loom ontology and ask it for a real row from a real Iceberg
table.* The first time the ontology does the thing the README claims.

**Scope note — why MCP moved up.** M1 was originally just the catalog + query slice, with the
MCP server deferred to M4 behind migrations and the action runtime. That ordering ends M1 at a
`loom query` dev command that only a test can see. The read-only half of the MCP surface is
~150 LOC on top of the resolver (registry introspection + two stdio handlers) and it's what
makes the milestone demoable to a person rather than a test suite. So M1 now covers the whole
**read** path top to bottom, and M4 keeps only what genuinely depends on M2/M3 — the `run_<action>`
tools and capability negotiation.

The write path is untouched by this: no migrations, no action runtime, no `_loom_meta`.

- [x] `config.py` — the `loom.yaml` project config from spec §6 (`catalogs`, `engine`, `mcp`),
      reusing the same accumulate-all-errors `Diagnostics` as the spec loader.
- [x] `catalog/` — a `Catalog` port + table introspection (columns → Iceberg types, field ids),
      with pyiceberg-backed implementations. Binds an `objectType.backing` to a live table.
- [x] Wire up **physical validation** — implement `validator.check_physical()` (the stub):
      table/column existence + type promotion-compatibility against the bound catalog.
      Surfaced as `loom validate --physical`.
- [x] `query/ir.py` — the logical plan node set: `GetByKey`, `Search`, `Traverse`, `Project`.
- [x] `query/engine.py` — the `Engine` port (`capabilities()` / `compile()` / `execute()`).
- [x] `query/engines/duckdb.py` — first adapter; lowers IR → DuckDB SQL over Iceberg.
- [x] `resolver.py` — ontology ops → IR; link `Traverse` → JOIN via from/to mapping (+ reverse).
- [x] `mcp/registry.py` — Ontology Model → read tool set (`get_` / `search_` / `list_` per
      object type, generic `traverse`), input schemas from `PropType.json_schema()`.
- [x] `loom serve` over stdio, read-only. Hard-rule test: no raw-SQL tool is ever exposed.
- [x] `examples/` — a seedable local Iceberg warehouse + the worked-example ontology, so the
      whole path is runnable by hand and in CI.

**Definition of done:** a test seeds rows into a local Iceberg table and reads them back through
the resolver + DuckDB adapter, including a one-hop link traversal — and `loom serve` exposes
that same ontology as MCP tools, driven end to end over stdio.

**Two decisions taken here:**
- **Local-first catalog for tests and examples.** pyiceberg's SQLite catalog over a
  filesystem warehouse (`type: iceberg-sql`) sits behind the same `Catalog` port as
  `iceberg-rest`, so CI needs no running services. A REST catalog is a config change, not a
  code change.
- **DuckDB reads Iceberg through pyiceberg, not the DuckDB Iceberg extension.** The adapter
  compiles IR to real DuckDB SQL, and `execute()` binds each referenced table as a named
  relation materialized by a pyiceberg scan — with the scan's own predicate/column pruning
  pushed down. This avoids a runtime extension install and keeps the adapter honest about
  dialect lowering.

## ⏳ M2 — Migration engine (`plan` / `apply`) — *in progress: only rollback is left*

*Goal: edit the YAML, run `loom plan`, see a classified diff; `loom apply` evolves Iceberg.*

- [x] Diff engine (`migrate/`) — classify changes: safe/additive · physical-safe (Iceberg
      field-id) · breaking.
- [x] `loom plan` — terraform-style dry-run of the classified diff.
- [x] `_loom_meta` state store — serialized applied spec + version + content-hash + history.
- [x] `loom apply` — write port + namespace creation; executes physical DDL in an Iceberg
      transaction; bumps version; idempotent.
- [x] `renamedFrom:` handling — treat as a field-id remap, not drop+add. Property-level and on
      `through` columns; a `rename` change kind classified safe; the old column no longer reported
      as unmanaged.
- [ ] Rollback path — restore prior spec + point physical schema at an earlier snapshot.
      (`_loom_meta` already stores the spec source verbatim, which is what this restores.)

**Four decisions taken in the `renamedFrom` slice:**
- **The spec says what it wants; the live catalog decides what that currently means.** One
  unchanged property plans four ways depending on which columns exist: the rename (old only),
  nothing at all (new only), a warned plain add (neither), and a refusal (both). The second is
  where idempotency comes from, and it needed no new mechanism — the baseline was already the
  live catalog, so a landed rename simply has nothing left to say about itself.
- **Both columns live is a breaking change, not a load error.** The spec isn't wrong; the *lake*
  is in a shape the plan can't resolve, which is what breaking already means here. Making it a
  change rather than a diagnostic keeps the rest of the diff on the page — an error aborts the
  plan and prints nothing — and routes it into the existing whole-plan refusal, which is the
  right outcome, since merging two columns means dropping one and Loom never drops.
- **`renamedFrom` outlives its migration, and Loom never suggests removing it.** One spec is
  deployed to lakes at different versions: after a rename ships to production, staging is still
  on the other side of it, so "you can delete this now" would be true of one catalog and false of
  another from the same file. Chained renames are deliberately not expressible for the same
  reason a state file isn't — a lake several versions behind should apply the versions it missed,
  not be modelled inside the spec.
- **A rename is `safe`, not `physical-safe`.** Physical-safe is the label meaning *the stored type
  moved and only field ids keep the files readable*; a rename moves neither type, nullability nor
  field id. What it does break is readers outside the ontology that select by name, and that goes
  in the plan's reason line rather than inflating a severity that means data safety.

  One implementation note worth recording, because it inverts the obvious: pyiceberg's
  `UpdateSchema` resolves every `path=` against the schema the transaction *opened* with, so a
  promotion following a rename in the same transaction must still name the **old** column. The
  plan therefore orders renames first and `alter_table` documents that ordering as part of its
  contract — it is what lets the adapter translate the later edits back.

**Three decisions taken in the `apply` slice:**
- **A breaking plan is refused whole.** Not "apply the safe parts and report the rest": a
  partial apply leaves the lake in a state that neither the old spec nor the new one describes,
  and `_loom_meta` would then be recording a spec that was never really applied. There is
  deliberately no `--force` — every breaking change either loses data or leaves existing rows
  violating a constraint that was just declared, and the fix is a data migration (add nullable,
  backfill, tighten) that Loom has no verb for until the action runtime lands.
- **Atomicity is per table, and says so.** Iceberg's unit is the table, so each table's column
  edits and its provenance properties commit in one transaction. There is no cross-table
  transaction to be had, so `apply` sequences tables, stops at the first failure, and reports
  exactly which ones landed rather than pretending the run was atomic.
- **Writes are a second port, not extra methods on `Catalog`.** `CatalogWriter` is what `apply`
  asks for; everything else in Loom holds a read-only `Catalog` and therefore cannot execute DDL
  at all. The same reasoning as "no raw-SQL tool is ever exposed", applied one layer down. One
  consequence worth stating: **`version` is global to the spec, not per catalog** — a row is
  written to each catalog the spec binds, but all carry the same number, so "version 7" names the
  same apply wherever you read it.

**Two decisions taken in the `plan` slice:**
- **The live catalog is the baseline, not a state file.** `Catalog.describe()` already returns
  column types and Iceberg field ids, which is everything a diff needs, so `plan` needs no
  `_loom_meta` to work — and diffing against one instead would make `plan` lie the moment
  somebody changed a table out of band. `_loom_meta` records what `apply` *did*; it is a
  history and an idempotency key, not the planner's source of truth. That's why it moved down
  the list into the `apply` slice.
- **Loom never proposes a drop.** An objectType maps a *subset* of a table's columns, so a
  column no property mentions is not a deleted property — it's someone else's data. Those are
  reported as unmanaged and left alone. It also means `plan` is not `validate --physical`: that
  pass treats a missing table as an error, which is exactly what a plan reports as a creation.

## ⏳ M3 — Action runtime (single-object writeback)

*Goal: `run_upgradeTier(...)` mutates one row atomically.*

- [ ] Parameter binding + validation-rule evaluation (reuse `expr` AST → evaluator).
- [ ] Effect compiler → Iceberg **catalog-level** write (equality-delete on PK + append), one txn.
- [ ] Optimistic concurrency — version/snapshot check; conflict → typed retryable error.
- [ ] Edit-log (audit) table — actor, action, before/after, snapshot id.
- [ ] Tests: create / modify / delete happy paths + a concurrent-conflict path.

---

## ⏳ M4 — MCP write surface + transport hardening

*Goal: the action runtime shows up as tools; serve over more than stdio.*

The read tools, the registry, and stdio `loom serve` land in M1 — what's left here is
everything that depends on M2/M3 or on a second transport.

- [ ] Per action: `run_<action>` with JSON Schema from parameters, description from the spec.
- [ ] Capability negotiation at serve — validate spec features vs. `engine.capabilities()`.
- [ ] HTTP transport alongside stdio.
- [ ] Structured tool errors — surface validation-rule failures and write conflicts as typed
      results an agent can act on, not opaque strings.

---

## ⏳ M5 — Governance

*Goal: row/column policies enforced identically for API and MCP callers.*

- [ ] Design the `governance.policies` grammar (deliberately deferred in v0).
- [ ] Enforce in the **resolver** (below MCP) so direct + agent calls filter the same way.
- [ ] Column masking + row predicates; policy tests over both paths.

---

## Backlog — spec edges (from spec-v0 §"Open edges")

Consciously deferred in v0; each is a self-contained follow-up:

- [ ] Composite (multi-property) primary keys — ripples into `key` exprs + objectRef encoding
- [ ] Complex property types — `array` / `struct` / `map`
- [ ] Computed / derived properties — backed by an expression instead of a column
- [ ] **Multi-object actions** — the post-v1 feature the single-object boundary reserves room for
- [ ] More engine adapters — Trino, Spark (+ route writes through native `MERGE` when
      `capabilities().native_merge`)

---

## Cross-cutting / infra

- [ ] `pyproject` extras for engine backends (`[duckdb]`, `[trino]`) and catalog clients
- [ ] Example end-to-end project under `examples/` (seedable local Iceberg + a demo agent loop)
- [ ] Docs site / expanded README now that M1 has landed
- [ ] Type-check (mypy) + lint (ruff) in CI alongside pytest
